# Employee-Attrition-Analysis-using-R

Overview

This project will attempt to explore and analyze the dataset to determine the attrition rate for this organization and answer general questions which may also generate new questions. Recommendations will also be given in the end. The analysis will employ simple descriptive statistics and graphical methods so that the reader can make sense of the dataset. The data importation, cleaning, manipulation will be done using R.

The focus here will be on the following factors (in no particular order):

1. Age
2. Salary
3. Performance Rating
4. Employee Engagement Survey scores
5. Employee Satisfaction scores
6. Termination Reasons

Data cleaning, manipulation, analysis, and visualizations were executed using R programming.
